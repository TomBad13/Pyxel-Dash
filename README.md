### Using the User Interface:
1. You will have to choose which Texture Pack you want.
2. You will have to choose which Game Mode you want.
3. A new UI will be opened with the Game!

### Controls:
There are only 1 action possible: Jump! To jump either press the Space Bar or the Upward Arrow on your Keyboard.

### Wins:
